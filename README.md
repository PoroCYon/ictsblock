# List of blocks by ICTS

This is a chronological list of (legit) domains (or email addresses)
erraneously blocked by an
[ICTS](https://icts.kuleuven.be/)
[security](https://www.kuleuven.be/wieiswie/nl/person/00017258)
[coordinator](https://be.linkedin.com/in/herman-van-uytven-63b1655b),
maintained by me personally. Both the date and the last hop in a traceroute
are indicated as well.

This is a list of false-positive blocks that I could verify. ICTS is often
asked to remove them, and usually does just that. Most (if not all) of the
domains below are now reachable again.

If you encounter another block, send me an email (pee see why at ulyssis dot
org) or ping me ('pcy') on [IRC](https://webirc.ulyssis.org/) (or `#ulyssis`
on `ircs://irc.ulyssis.org:6668`) so I can verify it. Or [send one to
ICTS](mailto:icts@kuleuven.be) so it can be resolved.
